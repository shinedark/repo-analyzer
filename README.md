# Repository Analysis Project

## Purpose

This project serves two main objectives:

1. **Study Tool**: A structured approach to analyze and understand code repositories
2. **Analysis Framework**: A tool for conducting systematic code repository reviews

## Why Repository Analysis?

Understanding existing codebases is crucial for:

- Learning best practices from other developers
- Evaluating potential dependencies
- Conducting technical due diligence
- Improving code comprehension skills

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository you want to analyze
2. Follow these analysis steps:
   - Review project structure
